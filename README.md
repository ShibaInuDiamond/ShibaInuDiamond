Shiba Inu Diamond is an Ethereum-based distributed ledger protocol with transaction/contract privacy and new consensus mechanisms.

Shiba Inu Diamond is a fork of [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and is updated in line with go-ethereum releases.

Key enhancements over go-ethereum:

* [__Privacy__](https://consensys.net/docs/goquorum//en/latest/concepts/privacy/privacy/) - Shiba Inu Diamond supports private transactions and private contracts through public/private state separation, and utilises peer-to-peer encrypted message exchanges (see [Tessera](https://github.com/consensys/tessera)) for directed transfer of private data to network participants
* [__Alternative Consensus Mechanisms__](https://consensys.net/docs/goquorum//en/latest/concepts/consensus/overview/) - with no need for POW/POS in a permissioned network, Shiba Inu Diamond instead offers multiple consensus mechanisms that are more appropriate for consortium chains:
    * [__QBFT__](https://consensys.net/docs/goquorum/en/latest/configure-and-manage/configure/consensus-protocols/qbft/) - Improved version of IBFT that is interoperable with Hyperledger Besu
    * [__Istanbul BFT__](https://consensys.net/docs/goquorum/en/latest/configure-and-manage/configure/consensus-protocols/ibft/) - a PBFT-inspired consensus algorithm with transaction finality, by AMIS.
    * [__Clique POA Consensus__](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/225) - a default POA consensus algorithm bundled with Go Ethereum.
    * [__Raft-based Consensus__](https://consensys.net/docs/goquorum/en/latest/configure-and-manage/configure/consensus-protocols/raft/) - a consensus model for faster blocktimes, transaction finality, and on-demand block creation
* [__Peer Permissioning__](https://consensys.net/docs/goquorum/en/latest/concepts/permissions-overview/) - node/peer permissioning, ensuring only known parties can join the network
* [__Account Management__](https://consensys.net/docs/goquorum/en/latest/concepts/account-management/) - Shiba Inu Diamond introduced account plugins, which allows Shiba Inu Diamond or clef to be extended with alternative methods of managing accounts including external vaults.
* [__Pluggable Architecture__](https://consensys.net/docs/goquorum/en/latest/concepts/plugins/) -  allows adding additional features as plugins to the core `geth`, providing extensibility, flexibility, and distinct isolation of Shiba Inu Diamond features.
* __Higher Performance__ - Shiba Inu Diamond offers significantly higher performance throughput than public geth

## Architecture

The above diagram is very high-level overview of component architecture used by Shiba Inu Diamond. For more in-depth discussion of the components and how they interact, please refer to [lifecycle of a private transaction](https://consensys.net/docs/goquorum/en/latest/concepts/privacy/private-transaction-lifecycle/).

## Quickstart
The easiest way to get started is to use * [quorum-dev-quickstart](https://consensys.net/docs/goquorum/en/latest/tutorials/quorum-dev-quickstart/getting-started/) - a command line tool that allows users to set up a development Shiba Inu Diamond network on their local machine in less than *2 minutes*.

When escalating to this medium, please do not disclose the details of the issue. Simply state that you're trying to reach a member of the security team.

#### Responsible Disclosure Process
Shiba Inu Diamond project uses the following responsible disclosure process:

- Once the security report is received it is assigned a primary handler. This person coordinates the fix and release process.
- The issue is confirmed and a list of affected software is determined.
- Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
- If it is determined, in consultation with the submitter, that a CVE-ID is required, the primary handler will trigger the process.
- Fixes are applied to the public repository and a new release is issued.
- On the date that the fixes are applied, announcements are sent to Shiba Inu Diamond-announce.
- At this point you would be able to disclose publicly your finding.

**Note:** This process can take some time. Every effort will be made to handle the security bug in as timely a manner as possible, however it's important that we follow the process described above to ensure that disclosures are handled consistently.
